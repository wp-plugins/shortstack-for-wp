== Description ==

[ShortStack](http://www.shortstack.com) is a self-service platform that helps
you build engaging social Campaigns.

ShortStack users can install this plugin to enable the web embed shortcode
`[shortstack]` within WordPress. This will embed ShortStack Campaigns within Posts
and Pages.

= Prerequisites =
- This plugin uses ShortStack's __Embed__ feature, which is included
  in a number of [ShortStack's paid plans](http://www.shortstack.com/pricing/).

= Setup =
1. Upload the `shortstack-wordpress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Usage =
1. Within the Campaign Designer, open the [Embed Settings](http://docs.shortstackapp.com/article/176-embed-to-the-web) panel for your published campaign.
2. Click on the __Using Wordpress?__ link below the Embed Code field.
3. Select and copy the __WordPress Shortcode__.
4. Paste the shortcode anywhere inside the body of a Post or Page within your WordPress installation.

  _Example:_ `[shortstack smart_url='//a.pgtb.me/#####' width='960' height='763']`
